# Contributing to Development

To contribute to the development of CrescentCMS, you will need to have a basic understanding of Astro, React, and TailwindCSS (with daisyui). You can learn more about Astro [here](https://docs.astro.build/).

To get started simply clone the repository and install all the necesary packages. You will need `Node 16+` and `yarn` as the package manager.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ * (static assets)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ * 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ * 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ env.d.ts  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

We use `yarn` as our package manager so all commands will be using `yarn` (Please do not use `npm` or other package managers).

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`      | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `yarn build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `yarn astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `yarn astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
